        <h3 class="section-title">Postdoctoral Positions  at MD Anderson Cancer Center</h3>
        <h3 class="section-title">Network Pharmacology and Targeted Cancer Therapy</h3>

        <p class="text-justify">
            Postdoctoral positions are available in the department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology
            at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC).
            We study resistance to targeted therapies and aim to discover combination therapies to overcome
            or forestall the resistance in cancer.
            Our laboratory combines advanced network inference and machine learning algorithms with drug perturbation
            and profiling experiments.
        </p>

        <h4>1. Computational Biology</h4>

        <p class="text-justify">
            Candidates must have a PhD in a relevant field
            (e.g., bioinformatics, biophysics, genomics, computer science, statistics) and a strong track record.
            A good understanding of statistics, experience in algorithm development and programming skills
            (e.g., R, Matlab, C++, Fortran, Python) are required.
            Knowledge of cancer biology, signaling pathways and drug response mechanisms is highly preferred.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Experimental biology</h4>

        <p class="text-justify">
            Candidates must have a PhD in a relevant field
            (e.g., cell biology, pharmacology, systems biology, biochemistry) and a strong track record.
            Experience in mammalian cell culture and drug perturbation experiments is required.
            Candidates must have the desire to gain experience in bioinformatics, very good quantitative skills,
            and statistics knowledge.
            For all candidates, a good understanding of cancer biology, signaling pathways and
            drug response mechanisms is highly preferred.

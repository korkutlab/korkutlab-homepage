                    We are most interested in response and resistance to targeted therapies in cancer.
                    Targeted agents interfere with activities of individual target molecules to inhibit
                    specific hallmarks of cancer. However, resistance to targeted agents emerges in almost all therapies.
                    We are developing and applying quantitative biology methods to understand mechanisms of
                    drug resistance and discover combination therapies to overcome (or forestall) the resistance.
                    We combine computational modeling and perturbation experiments. We use our in house
                    network pharmacology methods, pathway analysis, machine learning algorithms and statistics to
                    predict response how cancer cells response to untested targeted perturbations.  In the wet lab,
                    we generate drug response data sets to be used as constraints in our modeling studies and,
                    eventually, validate our predictions from the models
                    (predictions on signaling mechanisms and drug response).
